If there is no [[Unit]] or any [[constant]] indicators it's quite confusing as to how to measure stuff for example:
![[Pasted image 20240413214457.png]]
this rectangle created inside [inkscape](https://inkscape.org) but if someone asks you to find the height of this rectangle how would you tell them?
you can't right?
how about now?:

well now it became a little easier ,because you could just say it's 1 unit in height
but in real world what if people started to use whatever as their units? and you couldn't just tell the size of their [[foot]] as a unit right? thus the [[metric system]] was created
