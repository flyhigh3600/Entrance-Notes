## Entrance Notes

These markdowns serve as a comprehensive guide for those seeking complete information from NCERT class 11 and class 12 textbooks, presented concisely. I believe they fulfill this purpose effectively. You're welcome to use them for your exam preparations, following the guidelines outlined in my [LICENSE](LICENSE) file. For the optimal experience, I recommend opening these markdowns in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/download).

For details on replicating my setup, please refer to the [CONTRIBUTE](CONTRIBUTE.md) file. For miscellaneous development notes and information, see [Sticky Notes](Sticky%20Notes.md).
