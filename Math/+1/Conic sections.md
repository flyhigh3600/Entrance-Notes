#Math 
In [[3D Geometry]] the cone looks like:

That is :
- the cone has a <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">radius</mark> (**r**) which in this case is 2
- it has a <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">height</mark> (**h**) which as you may see is 5 in this case 
those are actually all there is to a cone but TBH it is not that useful right?
so let's find it's **[[Surface area]]**, **[[Volume]]**, etc...of it
___
To find those we have to first look at the figure and you can see that there is also another slant  at the cone's edge is currently unknown to us we call this The <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">slant height</mark>
