[[Electromagnetic Force]] is one of the [[Fundamental forces]] of this universe. It is what keeps the [[electron]]s and [[proton]]s together, preventing the universe from being a vast space of nothingness. Let's keep this in mind for a moment.

Now, let's delve into the phenomenon of the [[Tribo electric effect]], through which everyday items can attain [[Static Electricity]].for that let's explore the teeny tiny critters we call [[electron]]s.[[electron]]s are one of the [[Fundamental particles]] in this universe [they](electron) have a definite [[charge]], usually represented as $e$. However, assigning single-letter [[variable]]s for the notation of quantities and things might be one of the most annoying things [[Math]] brought and [[Physics]]  inherited ,Anyways, the **Charge of an electron** is approximately $e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19}C$; $C($ [[Coulomb]]s $) |$
thus $\approx 6\times 10^{18}$ [[electron]]s $\approx1$[[Coulomb]] of [[charge]].
now  assuming you might want to look at [[Static Electricity]]
for it's properties and slightly logical explanations that made sense to me.
