we observe shapes or objects as things with multiple [[Dimension]] in mathematics as as you may have already covered [[2D Geometry]] and [[2D Coordinates]] **x** and **y**  but if we think about it there is also a height to most objects we see so to accommodate for this with math, we have created height or *z* axis:

the math done in this axis is formally named [[3D Geometry]].
