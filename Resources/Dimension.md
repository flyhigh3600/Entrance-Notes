in [[Math]] especially [[Geometry]], [[Dimension]] doesn't really have a pleasing explanation so in a basic sense [[Dimension]]s are the minimum coordinate values needed to specify the position of an object or point in a specific space 
#### Now let's just hear it like a kid's story shall we?:

Imagine there's this big, beautiful lake where you love to swim and play. One day, you're playing with your favorite ball, and it accidentally rolls into the water. Oh no! But luckily, there's a crane operator nearby who's willing to help you get it back.

Now, the crane operator is blind, so they can't see the ball in the water. But you're really good at describing things, so you want to tell them exactly where the ball is so they can use the crane to pick it up.

You could say something like, "Hey, Mr. Crane Operator, can you move the crane arm six feet to the right, three feet forward, and two feet down? That's where my ball is floating in the water."

In this case, you're using three dimensions: right-left (horizontal), forward-backward (vertical), and up-down. These three dimensions help the crane operator know exactly where to move the crane to pick up the ball. It's like giving them a map with coordinates to follow, even though they can't see the ball themselves. Pretty cool, right?
