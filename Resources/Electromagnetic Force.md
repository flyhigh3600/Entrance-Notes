[[Electromagnetic Force]] is the second weakest of the [[Fundamental forces]], yet it is quite strong and has infinite range.

Unlike [[Gravity]], the [[Electromagnetic Force]] is not applicable to all matter. Its interactions occur between particles with [[charge]], whose origin involves complex phenomena from [[Quantum Mechanics]] that are beyond the scope of this note.

It is usually defined as the interaction between [[electron]]s and [[proton]]s, which are the most common [[particles]] with [[charge]]. They are assumed to have equal and opposite charges and are attracted to each other by the [[Electromagnetic Force]].

The equation for [this force](Electromagnetic%20Force.md)'s strength was calculated by "[[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]]" through various experiments resulting in what we now call the [[Coulomb's Law]]

[[Static Electricity]] demonstrations are one of the most visually intuitive and cost-effective experiments to observe the action of the [[Electromagnetic Force]] in real-time.
