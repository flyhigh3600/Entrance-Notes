#Physics 
The [[Fundamental forces]] of the universe are the inherent, immutable interactions that govern the behavior of [[particles]] and [[fields]] throughout the cosmos. These [[force]]s are essential components of the fabric of the universe itself, existing without further explanation or dependence on external factors. They dictate the [[motion]], [[structure]], and interactions of all matter and energy, from the smallest subatomic particles to the largest celestial bodies, and are fundamental to our understanding of the laws of nature.
