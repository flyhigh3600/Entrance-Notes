#### Formatting Guidelines:

- **Short and Complete**: Each document should be concise yet comprehensive, ensuring readability within 10 minutes for an average reader.
    
- **Use of Linked Files**: To explain complex topics or reference related information, use linked files. For example:
    
    - If you mention "Mathematics," link it to the relevant document: "[Mathematics](https://chat.openai.com/c/Math/Math)".
    - Use "%20" for spaces in file names within links, like so: "[Metric System](https://chat.openai.com/c/Resources/metric%20system)".

#### Note for Contributors:

> Our documents are designed to be easily digestible. For clarity, we've divided them into sections and linked related topics. Please adhere to these guidelines for consistency across contributions.
